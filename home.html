<h1> Home</h1>
<h3> Welcome! </h3>
    <p> For each of the 365 days in the year, our website will present you with a different daily challenge. Believe it or not, there are national and/or international holidays on each day of the year! </p>
    <p>Depending on what day it is, you'll find a different daily challenge that relates to that day's holiday. Some challenges are fun and silly, while others are designed to raise awareness about important social issues in our communities. Ultimately, these challenges are designed to expose you to different things and present you with some daily trivia. We encourage you to attempt these challenges and let us know if you have any suggestions!</p>
